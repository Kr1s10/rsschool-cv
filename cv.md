## About me

**My priority** is to work on real projects as a team. I recently started my career as a web developer, so I have little experience, but I am **ready** to overcome difficulties and gain experience with new knowledge. I know that I will achieve my goals, because I am a persistent person and it is interesting for me to develop in this area.

## Skills:
+ HTML5 & CSS3
+ JavaScript basics
+ PHP basics
+ Git/GitHub
+ Figma, Photoshop

## Code example
**Kata from Codewars:** write function bmi that calculates body mass index.

```
function bmi(weight, height) {

    const bmi  = weight / (height * height);

    return bmi <= 18.5 ? "Underweight" : bmi <= 25 ? "Normal" : bmi <= 30 ? "Overweight" : "Obese";

}
```
